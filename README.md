# Pong Game
This is a very simple and limited pong game made using the Python turtle library

## How to play
You play with the arrow keys as the player (on the right) and you try to hit the ball back to the AI

## Disclaimer
This game is unfinished and has multiple issues:
-The AI is impossible to beat
-Some bugs when hitting the ball from the top
-Probably more unseen bugs

## License
This project is under the Unlicense License so feel free to use it how you choose.

## Side note
This game was part of an online python course and is unlikely to be maintained. If you wish to use this starting code to make your own game or maintain it feel free to do so.
If you do not wish to help maintain this do not worry. I just wanted to showcase this limited project. I am not looking for any contributors to help maintain this game
